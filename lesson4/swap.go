/*
You are given an integer m (1 <= m <= 1 000 000) and two non-empty,
zero-indexed arrays A and B of n integers
	a0,a1,...,anâˆ’1 and b0,b1,...,bnâˆ’1
respectively (0 <= ai,bi <= m).

The goal is to check whether there is a swap operation which can
be performed on these arrays in such a way that the sum of elements
in array A equals the sum of elements in array B after the swap.
By swap operation we mean picking one element from array A and
one element from array B and exchanging them.
